IPv6 Subnet Calculator / Tool    
Latest Version: 3.2.1    

IPv6 Subnet Calculator / Tool application lets you plan/subnet your assigned address for all 128 bits.
We are in the transition phase of our networks addressing structure from IPv4 to IPv6, and I believe that the network engineers should easily plan their IPv6 addressing /subnetting infrastructure without any error. For this purpose, I wrote and distributed a free IPv6 Subnetting Tool / Calculator both with C# and Java JDK 1.8 based on JavaFX Application Frameworks. I distributed the applications in the hope that it will be useful for your subnet calculations. I will try to develop the software continuously, so please don't hesitate to comment/inform for any bugs or new feature suggestions.
